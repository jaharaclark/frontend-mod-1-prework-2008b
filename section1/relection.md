## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
The SuperLearner Article felt like a lot of the things that I already do. I read A LOT. Before Covid when I was traveling for work, I'd read a book every three or four days. I've slowed down a bit now, but I think reading is incredibly important. I also think learning is a process or a journey. I don't think that it's something you ever "complete" or "arrive at", which fits in with having a growth mindset. I'm trying continually be better tomorrow than I was yesterday. A big thing that resonates with me is the idea of teaching others. I learned years ago as a trainer that in order to train someone else, you have to either a) know as much as you humanly possibly can to be able to answer questions or b) know where to find the answers. I get a lot of joy out of teaching others because I know that I too am learning in the process. The best way I'm able to take care of my brain is by sleeping at least 7 hours a night. I know that I'm not able to function properly if I'm not well rested. And like I've said before, my whole life runs in 30 minutes on, 10 minutes off, which has completely ratcheted up my productivity while letting me feel like I'm not chained to the computer. The only thing I can think to add would be that SuperLearners ask for help early and often. There is no reason to desperately struggle alone.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
Number - either a whole integer or a float which contains a decimal
String - a list of characters held between two quotes. Strings tend to be human-readable
Boolean - value that, based on criteria, is either true or false

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
console.log("Hello World!")

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
"//" or "/*" are both ways to indicate comments. Comments are life saving. They're a way to give an explanation or add instructions without those phrases being included as part of the actual code.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable is a label used to assign a value for something that can be modified, changed or made different as needed. That is what I would tell my 5 year old. (Is that how you're supposed to explain it to a 5 year old? I don't know what else I would say. That's also probably why my 2 year olds speak 3 languages.)

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
I just logged off USAA. I'm sure they have:
var accountBalance which is a float
var memberIdNumber which is a number
var transaction which is a string

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
Concatenation is the joining of two items, that may differ from each other, in the same string of code using a plus sign. It is not like a math problem where the things are being combined, they are being joined while maintaining their own individual characteristics.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
On USAA I think the developers use concatenation in the explanations of account balances for users to be able to read the information in a sentence. For example: "On " date + transactionAmount + " was spent at " + transactionLocation "."

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
While I realize that "not having a question is not an option", I don't have any questions about the work. That is happening for me. Where I do have plenty of question is all centered around ease of use of this Mac. That struggle is real and I'm finding that keyboard shortcuts that I would have used don't work, that things that seem like there-should-be-a-better-way are feeling impossible. I wonder how much slower this is making me than my peers.
