## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
I'm not going to lie, this is not going to be the response you're looking for: I hated the Growth Mindset article. I tried to read it, I really did, but it was LITTERED with poor punctuation, poor capitalization conventions and was difficult to read. I took nearly nothing away that the author was trying to convey because I was so distracted as to how it appeared on the page.

SO!!!!! What I really took away from the article is that how we write is important. Yes, I mean how we are presenting ourselves professionally (1), but also how our code looks on the screen (2). I wouldn't want to work or do business with the person who wrote the article because I get the feeling it was copied and pasted or taken from somewhere else and editing/proofreading didn't happen. When I've published something online, or if I know I'm writing something that is going to go online, I'm making absolutely sure that it looks beautiful because that work is a reflection of me - or that I trust that the people that I'm working with are going to make sure of that. It's the same with code, I want to make sure it looks absolutely beautiful on the page so that I'm able to convey that I'm a knowledgable, reliable, competent professional so I can ultimately be an employed purple sparkly unicorn with all my certifications. I absolutely understand that mistakes happen and one or two is fine, but when it takes away from the message of the work, there was a gross breakdown somewhere along the way.

P.s., That sentiment is probably why I'm a front ender.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
Even before I got to Turing, growth was something that was a part of my regular daily life. Growth is why I seldom listen to music in the car; I listen to books almost everywhere I go. Growth is why my children are two and can speak in English, Spanish and American Sign Language. Growth is why I'm willing to be up at 5am everyday and behind the computer no later than 5:15am so that I can take advantage of the fact that the rest of my house doesn't wake until 6:30am or so. I get more done in 90 minutes than I will the rest of the day, Growth is the reason that this summer I've finished my Salesforce Certified Administrator training, Google IT Support Specialist training am currently working though my Turing Mod 0 and Mod 1 pre work during the day and getting my PMP certification at night so I can be that much more employable when Mod 4 is over. I don't know what to do other than grow and in fact, I don't understand when people _aren't_ intentional about growing. My mother-in-law and I have argued about why her husband didn't *make* her go to college ('scuse me....? That wasn't his job) and why I do so much instead of simply taking care of my kids. I believe the world is constantly changing; it's my job to be better tomorrow than I was yesterday, lest I be left behind. If I am, that's no one's fault but my own.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
Lord and Taylor probably uses an array on their website when they list the item numbers of all of the women's tops that are currently available in a size four.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
An array method is a way of taking a related group of something (in our limited experience usually strings or numbers) and then evaluating the values of that group as part of a larger function or code block to accomplish a task.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
The purpose of a loop is to execute a function a specified number of times or until a specific condition is met. We would use a loop in conjunction with an array when we needed to assess different values every time the loop ran.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
"A loop is a task that runs over and over again, some times using different values, until it did it a specific number of times or achieved the value it was supposed to."

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
Hmmmm.... at this point, I don't think I have any questions. I think I need more practice on problems like at the end of loops-arrays.js. I worked on it for about 10ish minutes without having to use Google or Slack. I want to get better at identifying the steps and understanding why it works the way it does. I simply used "guess-and-check" until I got it right.
