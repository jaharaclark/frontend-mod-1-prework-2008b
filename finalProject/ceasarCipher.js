Caesar Cipher

function cipherInput (str, num) {
// It has to be a function in order to work. This part seems basic.
  var lowerCaseStr = str.toLowerCase() // This is going to convert the string to lower case text because technically captial characters and lower case characters are different, even though they're the same letter.

  var alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".split("")
  // This enables the alphabet to be split into an array, which means that each letter is going to be able to be referenced individually.
}
